I am a Technical Program Manager looking for risk patterns. Below is a CSV export of my team's recent sprint data.
Please analyze this data acting as a Data Scientist and Agile Coach.
1. Quantitative Analysis (The 'SQL' View):
Calculate the 'Say/Do' ratio (Original Estimate vs. Time Spent) for each Assignee.
Identify tickets that have a Sprint_Count > 1 (these are spillovers).
2. Pattern Recognition (The 'AI' View):
What do the spillover tickets have in common? Look at Story Points, Type, or Summary keywords.
Is there a correlation between Flagged_Count and spillover?
3. Predictive Risk Model:
Based on this historical data, create a simple heuristic (rule of thumb) I can apply to future planning. (e.g., 'If a ticket has X characteristics, it has an 80% chance of failing')."
